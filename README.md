# iOS Jailbreak Detector


## Overview

A drop-in class that dynamically detects whether the iOS device your app is running on has been jailbroken or not.

## 100% App Store Submission Safe. No Private API

I myself have a few apps using this class to detect jailbreak devices. So far 100% App Store submission safe.
